<div id="storeArea" data-size="128" hidden><div tiddler="shoes" tags="current" created="201804171642" modifier="twee" twine-position="9603,398">Picking through the disorganized chaos of the shoe display proves to be both annoying and time consuming. It’s hard enough for Ash to find shoes in her size among the mass, and even harder to find a pair of matching shoes. It strikes Ash as strange: why would anyone just take one shoe out of a pair? Maybe the missing shoes are somewhere else in the store, but regardless, Ash eventually ends up with [[one pair|shoes2]] of hiking boots in women’s size seven.</div><div tiddler="photo" tags="fback" created="201804171542" modifier="twee" twine-position="284,272">Ash squirms uncomfortably in her nice clothes. Her mom had picked out clothes for their whole family, so they’ll be color coordinated in the picture. Ash and her dad had both grumbled about it, but had both ultimately agreed to go along with it.\n\n“Alright now, smile,” the photographer says with a fake smile of his own.\n\nHer father pulls a goofy face and Ash laughs as her mom scowls at him.\n\n“Please, I want a nice picture of the three of us,” she scolds.\n“Sorry, dear,” Ash’s dad says, but he gives Ash a secret wink as he turns his attention back to the camera.\n\nAsh’s smile at the very least, looks genuine in this photo, and it’s the one her mom eventually gets framed and puts at the top of the mantle.\n\n&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;</div><div tiddler="bedroom" tags="current" created="201804171616" modifier="twee" twine-position="6914,14">The bedroom is almost exactly the same as it was when [[Ash was here last|bffs]], only a week before the world ended. Jaime’s posters still hang on the walls, and there’s dirty laundry overflowing from the hamper in the corner. Jaime’s laptop is still on her desk, closed and dark, but her phone is gone, likely with Jaime, wherever she is. Ash sighs and sits on her best friend’s bed, unmade of course, because Jaime never makes her bed. Ash wonders idly if that’s something that even matters anymore in this new world. Jaime’s mother would be complaining about Ash sitting on the furniture while dirty, and she wonders if that matters anymore either.\n\nBut it doesn’t matter to Ash; she’s tired and all of a sudden everything about the terrible day comes crashing down onto her, leaving her utterly exhausted physically, mentally, spiritually. The only concession she makes to propriety is to kick her shoes off before she tucks herself underneath Jaime’s covers and [[falls asleep|dreams]].\n</div><div tiddler="birds" tags="fback" created="201804171613" modifier="twee" twine-position="6250,152">Her first morning in the new house, Ash wakes up to the sound of birds. They sound different than the birds she’s used to; less of a chirp and more of a coo. Kind of like pigeons, but more musical. She lies in bed for several extra minutes, just listening to them. When she does finally go downstairs for breakfast, she resists the temptation to ask her parents about the birds. She curious, but something about listening to them seems private, and she ultimately decides to research them on her own.\n\nWhen she learns that they’re called mourning doves her first thought is that it’s too sad of a name. The bird’s calls are beautiful, and lying in bed for several extra minutes in the [[early mornings|dusk]] on the weekends quickly becomes part of Ash’s routine.\n</div><div tiddler="run1" tags="current" created="201804171613" modifier="twee" twine-position="6117,14">Her heart sinking, Ash quickly back away, turning back down Miller Street before any of the zombies can catch sight of her. Once she rounds the corner she feels safe enough to turn her back on the creatures and she takes off [[running|run2]].</div><div tiddler="imaginings" tags="current" created="201804171559" modifier="twee" twine-position="4370,17">Briefly, she imagines it. She imagines running home, unlocking the door, and finding her parents miraculously just inside, [[waiting|imaginings2]] for her with open arms.</div><div tiddler="run2" tags="current" created="201804171613" modifier="twee" twine-position="6249,16">She runs for several long minutes, down once familiar streets. She quickly loses track of where she is, taking random turns through alleys and backyards whenever she sees a figure on the horizon. Eventually she stops seeing any and the fear fades, along with the adrenaline.\n\nAsh slumps against the side of the closest house and gasps for breath, grabbing at the painful stitch in her side. As she slowly gets her breath back an odd sort of finality settles around her. Her home is truly gone now; even if she were to work her way back and wait for the creatures to clear the area it wouldn’t be the what it was, what Ash desperately [[wants it to be|birds]].\n</div><div tiddler="a11pt3" tags="current" created="201804171609" modifier="twee" twine-position="5539,681">Being in this aisle makes Ash hyper aware of the blood and grime that’s still clinging to her skin. It’s especially bad on her hands and forearms, even though it’s dried and is starting to peel. Absentmindedly, Ash starts picking at it, peeling the dried blood off. She drops the flakes onto the mess of the aisle floor as she [[leaves|is1]] it.</div><div tiddler="ohshit" tags="current" created="201804171534" modifier="twee" twine-position="1174,18">Panicked by the realization, Ash practically runs to the front door and locks the deadbolt. After a moment more of hesitation she grabs the hallway table and drags it over to block the door. It’s probably at best a token gesture but Ash doesn’t want anything into her [[house|house]] any time soon, especially not Mr. Lewis’ surprisingly active corpse.</div><div tiddler="rei2" tags="current" created="201804171641" modifier="twee" twine-position="9602,12">Overall, the place in reasonably good shape. Sure there’s some overturned racks and various merchandise strewn across the floors, but there’s no large pools of blood, which is a huge plus.\n\nDirectly in front of the entrance, in the middle of the store, is the [[apparel|clothes]] section. There’s lots of clothes strewn on the ground around it, along with clothing racks and hangers, but there seems to be a pretty sizable selection left.\n\nIn the rear left of the store is [[camping gear|camp]]; tents, sleeping bags, all sorts of things that could prove useful.\n\nThe rear right is [[walls and walls of shoes|shoes]]. Hiking shoes, running shoes, work shoes, boots. Some of them have been knocked off the wall display, and even from afar Ash can see the shoe boxes flung all over the section, but there still seems to be a lot of shoes left behind, she can probably find some to fit her. \n</div><div tiddler="media2" tags="current" created="201804171555" modifier="twee" twine-position="3186,279">But most of all [[no piece of fiction|mediafb]] had ever conveyed how unsettling it is to look at the streets you've been walking as long as you can remember and see them full of bodies instead of cars, what it’s like to navigate through puddles of blood and gore instead of rain and garbage, and how crushing it is to realize that your old, normal, boring life is &lt;i&gt;right there&lt;/i&gt; and yet completely [[out of reach|killaftermath]].</div><div tiddler="media1" tags="current" created="201804171554" modifier="twee" twine-position="3189,149">No amount of media could have prepared her for the [[reality|media2]] she's found herself in. No movie had never mentioned how heavy the air gets with the stench of rotting corpses. Books had never described what it feels like to have cold blood dry tacky on your skin or that walking through miles of blood stained streets makes your shoes stick to the ground. Games hadn't prepared her for the necessity of cleaning the remnants of dead flesh off her bat, or for how numb her arm feels now.</div><div tiddler="parents" tags="current" created="201804171536" modifier="twee" twine-position="1440,148">She hadn't been surprised to wake up and find her parents gone, after all, they'd been out the night before. She's not even surprised when the day continues to pass and they still don't return; what with the bodies in the streets it's not surprising that no live people have come around.\n\nIt still leaves her feeling unsettled, to be a lone person in a house made to house a [[family|family]].\n</div><div tiddler="zombie3" tags="current" created="201804171634" modifier="twee" twine-position="9334,10">This one Ash will have to kill if she wants to get into the store, there’s no way around it. It’s too close to the door for her to sneak past.\n\nAsh sneaks up to it, holding her breath. The creature hasn’t moved, swaying in one spot. She gets closer to this one than the ones she’s killed before by the time it notices her, and it barely has the chance to stumble towards here before Ash is swinging her bat to meet it.\n\n&lt;&lt;if visited (&quot;fightit&quot;)&gt;&gt;Unlike the last one this one goes down hard and easily, and Ash is able to move away from it fast enough that she only adds a few new spots of blood to her clothes.\n\n&lt;&lt;else if visited(&quot;fightzombie2&quot;)&gt;&gt;Unlike the last one this one goes down hard and easily, and Ash is able to move away from it fast enough that she only adds a few new spots of blood to her clothes.\n\n&lt;&lt;else if visited(&quot;ignore&quot;,&quot;ignore2&quot;)&gt;&gt;Prepared now for the gore show that results, she takes several quick steps backwards from it as soon as she finishes the swing, and neatly avoids the falling body of the creature, and only gets a few new spots of blood on her already covered pants and new shirt.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n\nShe waits a few seconds, catching her breath, before she [[pushes open|rei1]] the door to the shop.\n\n</div><div tiddler="zombie2" tags="current" created="201804171533" modifier="twee" twine-position="921,18">This one is much closer, on the sidewalk that runs in front of Ash’s front yard. It seems to be making its way over to the fallen…thing. At least, its body is pointed that way, although, disturbingly it’s head is tilted backwards. It staggers into a position that gives Ash a look at its [[face|mrlewis]], and this time she yelps and physically jumps back from her window.</div><div tiddler="StoryTitle" tags="" created="201804151735" modifier="twee" twine-position="10,150">ASH</div><div tiddler="secondday2" tags="current" created="201804171619" modifier="twee" twine-position="7439,15">Like she had with her own house, Ash takes care to lock the door to Jaime’s house behind her, pocketing the key. She’s not sure why, but she feels better knowing that Jaime’s house is an option. However, there at the end of Cherry street is one of the creatures, walking almost mechanically from one side of the street to the other. The street isn’t wide enough for Ash to slip past it unnoticed.\n\nAsh sighs. At least it’s only one, she’s killed one of these already there’s no reason to think she should be unable to kill another.\n\nShe [[grips her bat tighter|secondfight1]], preparing.\n</div><div tiddler="periodfb" tags="fback" created="201804171609" modifier="twee" twine-position="5413,810">&quot;It's not gonna work, Mom!&quot; Ash wails, knocking her mother's hand away.\n\nShe's sitting on the toilet sobbing and shaking as her mom desperately tries to teach her how to use a tampon. It hurts and it's difficult and it’s &lt;i&gt;messy&lt;/i&gt;. There's blood not just on the toilet but also smeared on Ash's hands and the inside of her thighs. She wants to wipe the tears from her face, but she can't, not with her hands this dirty.\n\n&quot;Maybe you should just use pads for a while,&quot; Ash's mom suggests.\n\nBut Ash lost patience with her mom's platitudes an hour ago. Her mom had been excited about her period just a few hours ago, when Ash had come into her room, scared, to tearfully tell her what had happened. &quot;We should go out for dinner,&quot; her mom had suggested, &quot;anywhere you'd like.&quot;\n\nAnd then Ash had reminded her of the swim meet that was in just three hours. She can't swim like this.\n\nAsh cries even harder, ashamed of both the blood and the tears.\n\n&quot;I'm sure your coach won't mind if you miss one meet,&quot; her mom says.\n\n&quot;That's not the point!&quot; Ash cries. &quot;You don't get it, leave me alone!&quot;\n\nHer mom hesitates, clearly awkward and unsure as Ash continues to cry. After several moments she does leave, placing tampons and pads on the counter should Ash want to try again.\n\nWith her mom gone and her dad banished from this part of the house for the time being, Ash is alone, and she finds that it just lets her feel free enough to cry &lt;i&gt;harder&lt;/i&gt;, as she lies her head on the counter, sobs, and [[bleeds|a11pt3]].\n</div><div tiddler="imaginings2" tags="current" created="201804171600" modifier="twee" twine-position="4497,17">But even as Ash imagines it the fantasy starts to fall apart. She hasn’t seen another truly living person in weeks, and if her parents haven’t made it back to their house now, she knows that they probably never will. She screws her eyes shut against the prickling of tears, but a few escape and run down her cheeks. Ash has always hated crying, but she can’t help it.\n\nBesides, [[there’s only the dead|os6]] to see her.\n</div><div tiddler="standground" tags="current" created="201804171548" modifier="twee" twine-position="2789,291">With a sort of grim determination Ash plants her feet and angles her hips into a proper batting stance, [[waiting|fight]] for the creature to come into her range.</div><div tiddler="secondfightend" tags="current" created="201804171622" modifier="twee" twine-position="8100,17">If only getting the blood and chunks of dead flesh clinging to Ash were as easy to get away from. It all dies quickly, turning tacky and uncomfortable quickly in the summer heat. She desperately wants to wash, but plumbing has been down for two weeks and water is too precious a resource for her to waste it.\n\nSo Ash soldiers on, trying her best not to think about it. It’s hard; the equipment store is several miles away and the longer Ash walks, the more oppressive the heat starts to feel, even though it’s not as hot as it could be. Sweat soon starts to mix with the blood and dirt that’s already covering her and the mixture starts to harden, pulling uncomfortably at her skin.\n\nAfter about an hour of walking she [[loses patience|cleaning]] with it and as much as she’s loathe to, pulls a water bottle out of her bag and pulls her t-shirt off. She has to turn it inside out to find a clean spot which she pours water on before running it over her arms.\n</div><div tiddler="return" tags="current" created="201804171549" modifier="twee" twine-position="2657,286">Stepping back doesn’t do what Ash had hoped it would. The creature once again adjusts its path to meet her, and with a sinking stomach Ash knows she has [[no other choice|standground]].</div><div tiddler="tampons" tags="current" created="201804171609" modifier="twee" twine-position="5412,680">There are so &lt;i&gt;many&lt;/i&gt; of them left, hadn't other people thought about this? The world may have ended, but it’s not like Ash’s body has changed or stopped any of its functions. Besides, she's not sure yet if the creatures have a sense of smell, but if they do it makes sense that they could smell blood, especially fresh blood, and she doesn't want to give them any more reason to attack her. Bugs already attack her enough when she's [[on her period|periodfb]], she doesn't need zombies doing it too.\n\nAsh makes sure to take several boxes of each. Not only does she expect periods, but she's pretty sure that she once read about people using tampons to plug bullet wounds too, so they might even be extra useful. Their purpose &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; to soak up [[blood.|a11pt3]]\n</div><div tiddler="food" tags="current" created="201804171538" modifier="twee" twine-position="1696,18">She makes sure to ration the food. She still eats three meals a day, but she keeps them small. She uses the perishables in the fridge first, before it has a chance to go bad. It’s not like she has much [[to do|timepass]], so she’s able to put more effort into cooking than she normally does. It’s not that terrible an effort to cook vegetables instead of just eating cereal for every meal. </div><div tiddler="os2" tags="current" created="201804171556" modifier="twee" twine-position="3579,15">Uneasy, she steps more carefully through the bodies as she gets closer to the store, paying [[closer attention|bodieszoom]] to them.\n</div><div tiddler="os5" tags="current" created="201804171558" modifier="twee" twine-position="4104,16">Suddenly, Ash wants nothing more than to go home. To go back to her old life. She's struck by the desire to turn around and run until she reaches the safety of her house where she can lock the door and never venture back out into the world ever.\nShe absolutely [[hates|fuckdis]] this.\n</div><div tiddler="os4" tags="current" created="201804171558" modifier="twee" twine-position="3973,15">She feels silly, standing in the middle of a bunch of dead people, mourning their mistakes, but she can't help it.\nThe world remains silent and still as Ash [[fights back|os5]] tears.\n</div><div tiddler="os7" tags="current" created="201804171601" modifier="twee" twine-position="4755,17">She gulps down the rest of her tears and wipes at them, smearing the blood from her hands on her cheeks. As she crosses the rest of the parking lot she manages to compose herself, at least a little bit.  She’s only trembling a little bit by the time she reaches the door and [[pushes|opattempt1]] them open.</div><div tiddler="os6" tags="current" created="201804171600" modifier="twee" twine-position="4625,17">All that’s left is Ash, the dead, and the monsters. And if Ash ran home the monsters would still be there, and Ash would run out of food.\n\nThere's only one choice. She has to keep going [[forward|os7]].\n</div><div tiddler="notlife" tags="current" created="201804171547" modifier="twee" twine-position="2601,21">It's not until several blocks along that Ash finally sees signs of life.\n\nOr well, not-life.\n\nShe grips her bat tighter as the creature comes toward her. Now faced with one of them coming at her all jerky motions and decaying flesh, she feels weird likening this...&lt;i&gt;thing&lt;/i&gt; to the zombies she's experienced safely behind screens and paper.\n\nIt's slow, but it's clearly seen her, and is interested.\nAsh hesitates, deciding. Should she [[bob to the left|left]] or [[weave to the right|right]]?\n</div><div tiddler="fall" tags="current" created="201804171533" modifier="twee" twine-position="790,16">It falls face first onto the pavement, not even bothering to lift its hands to break the fall.\n\nAsh almost winces out of reflex at the impact. The creature’s skull cracks against the pavement, and although distance and the walls of her house and the glass in the window mute the sound, Ash can still imagine it.\n\nThe figure makes no move to get up again, but its feet continue to move against the pavement, as if it thinks it’s still walking.\n\nIt’s very weird and confusing and Ash watches it struggle for several long moments. It certainly &lt;i&gt;looks&lt;/i&gt; like a human being, but people don’t move like that, and people pick themselves back up when they fall over.\n\nFrom the left this time Ash seems more movement, [[another figure|zombie2]] with the same lumbering movement.\n</div><div tiddler="fightzombie2" tags="current" created="201804171629" modifier="twee" twine-position="8945,139">The creature has a bit of a strange path that Ash tries to figure out as she wakes her way across the parking lot towards it. But there doesn’t appear to any pattern to its movement.\n\nWhen Ash is close enough for it to sense her, it gives a sudden lurch in her direction and practically lunges for her.\n\nAsh takes a few steps back on instinct but the creature follows after her, still moving in awkward bursts.\n\nAsh readies herself and [[swings|fightzombie2pt2]].\n</div><div tiddler="dreams" tags="current" created="201804171617" modifier="twee" twine-position="7047,14">Ash dreams. Her dreams are disjointed and weird…\n\n…there are zombies in front of her before they shift into her parents…\n\n…who run away when Ash tries to reach out for them, turning a corner and ultimately disappearing…\n\n…into the bread aisle of the grocery store, now stocked only with rows and rows of plain Wonder Bread…\n\n…that becomes drenched with blood as Ash continues down the aisle…\n\n…until she is drenched in blood, it’s pouring over her hands, down her face, and seeping out from under her pants[[…|wakeup]]\n</div><div tiddler="outside2" tags="current" created="201804171545" modifier="twee" twine-position="2343,20">&lt;i&gt;Just like that,&lt;/i&gt; she says to herself, trying not to step over the bodies. &lt;i&gt;A treasure hunt.&lt;/i&gt; She carefully doesn't think about how the mess is made up of what used to be [[people.|outside3]]</div><div tiddler="bat" tags="current" created="201804171540" modifier="twee" twine-position="2084,20">With her bat in hand, and her [[backpack|Backpack]] filled, Ash stands in front of her own front door. She drags the table aside, clearing space for the front door to open. She unlocks the door and wraps her hand around the knob, hesitating for several long seconds before she [[pushes|outside]] the door open.</div><div tiddler="sleepoverfb" tags="fback" created="201804171615" modifier="twee" twine-position="6643,147">“Shh,” Jaime says, a finger pressed to her lips.\n\nAsh nods and creeps after Jaime down the stairs. They’re supposed to be asleep, Jaime in her bed and Ash on the blow-up mattress, but instead they’re creeping downstairs to the TV room. Jaime’s parents had kicked them off of Jaime’s brand-new PlayStation at only 10 PM, sending them to bed, but now it’s the middle of the night and Jaime’s parents are asleep, so Ash and Jaime are creeping back down to finish their game.\n\nOnce they’re down the stairs Ash whispers, “What if they hear the TV?”\n\n“We’ll keep the volume down low,” Jaime assures her, deftly hopping over the [[creaky spot|jaimes3]] on the floor.\n</div><div tiddler="zoom" tags="current" created="201804171532" modifier="twee" twine-position="661,15">It’s a completely inhuman movement. The figure doesn’t lean into the motion, almost like the fact that it’s moving comes as a surprise. Its knees are barely bending, and its upper body is rigid and stiff.\n\nAsh watches, morbidly fascinated, it as it takes several more of these jerky steps, still not rolling its ankles or bending its knees. [[It continues down her street|fall]], slow and creepy, until its feet run into one of the bodies strewn about the street.\n</div><div tiddler="ignore" tags="current" created="201804171626" modifier="twee" twine-position="8674,143">Deciding that it’s not worth the risk, Ash carefully takes several steps away from the creature, until she’s sure that she’s out of its range.\n\nThat just leaves the [[zombie on the far side of the parking lot|zombieno2]] and the one in front of the store.\n</div><div tiddler="clothes" tags="current" created="201804171642" modifier="twee" twine-position="9604,140">Her mind on the ruined shirt she left behind, Ash heads towards the apparel section of the store. She starts by digging through the piles of clothes on the floor, looking for things that might fit her.\n\nShe hadn’t expected there to be underwear, but there is, and Ash eagerly grabs several packs, to tear open so she can roll up the underwear inside and shove them into the empty spaces in her bag. Without a good way for her to do laundry, she’s definitely running out of underwear the fastest.\n\nSimilarly, she also takes quite a few workout tanks; they’re small and can easily rolled up and stuffed alongside what she already has in her pack. And given how fast she seems to be going through clothes, it can’t hurt to have [[alternate layers|clothes2]].\n</div><div tiddler="right" tags="current" created="201804171547" modifier="twee" twine-position="2668,158">Ash takes several quick steps to the right. It confuses the creature, but only for a few seconds before it adjusts to Ash’s new trajectory.\n\n\nAsh bites her lip as she thinks. Stepping [[forward|forward]] will just take her closer to the creature. More steps to the left aren’t likely to confuse it anymore than it had the first time. Stepping [[back to the left|return]] will put her back where she was, but maybe it will confuse the creature just enough. It doesn’t seem particularly smart. Or, she thinks, she could [[stand her ground|standground]] and fight this thing.</div><div tiddler="house" tags="current" created="201804171535" modifier="twee" twine-position="1305,18">The first thing Ash does when her racing heart calms and her makeshift barricade stays in place is look through her empty house.\n\nShe finds nothing.\n\nWhile it had felt normal in the first few moments, the early morning-esque stillness becomes more and more unsettling as the day progresses.\n\nThe ambient noises of the house are there: the &lt;i&gt;swish&lt;/i&gt;es and &lt;i&gt;clunk&lt;/i&gt;s of the plumbing, the almost indistinguishable &lt;i&gt;hum&lt;/i&gt; of the lights, the occasional &lt;i&gt;creak&lt;/i&gt; of something settling. Occasionally, she can still hear the birds &lt;i&gt;coo&lt;/i&gt;. It’s a weirdly haunting sound now; an uncomfortable reminder that she can hear them only because things are unusually quiet.\n\nThere’s no hint of distant traffic, no muffled noise from her neighbor’s television.\n\n[[Ash is alone|alone]] with the sound of her own breathing, her own footsteps, and the beat of her own heart.\n</div><div tiddler="secondday" tags="current" created="201804171618" modifier="twee" twine-position="7309,13">In the light of day it’s easier to see things that Ash had missed coming in last night. Spread out on the dining room table are a bunch of supplies, clearly considered by Jaime’s family for packing and then deemed not worth the weight. Among the scattered items are parts of mountaineering sets. Which makes sense, given how Jaime’s parents had been such avid outdoors people.\n\nAsh looks at the gear and thinks. While mountaineering gear might not be specifically useful, it clearly seems that Jaime’s parents were on the right track. An outdoor recreation store isn’t as obvious a place to go as a grocery store and might still have things in it that Ash could make use of. [[It’s quite a bit of a walk|secondday2]] to the nearest store, easily several miles, but it is at the very least some kind of plan.\n</div><div tiddler="ignore2" tags="current" created="201804171629" modifier="twee" twine-position="8812,139">Deciding not to bother with the creature, Ash quickly realizes that if she stays far enough to the right of the parking lot, she can probably avoid the it completely. With this in mind she gets as far away from it as possible without leaving the store area entirely before she starts creeping forward. She keeps an eye on it as she creeps closer and closer to the store, until she’s far enough way that she’s comfortable focusing solely on [[the one in front of the door|zombie3]].</div><div tiddler="jaimes1" tags="current" created="201804171614" modifier="twee" twine-position="6517,15">In a stroke of luck, Jaime’s house looks to be largely unaffected.

Most of the cases are broken and almost everything is in the wrong case, but Ash is still able to find a few albums that she enjoys.

Her dad had carried her inside the house and set her on the bathroom counter, carefully dripping water over it while her mom had fetched Fritz for her.\n\nTears are still drying on Ash’s face but she’s much less scared now with Fritz in her arms and her mom’s hand running soothingly over the top of her head.\n\n“We’ve got you, honey,” her mom assures her.\n\n&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="forward" tags="current" created="201804171548" modifier="twee" twine-position="2531,288">A step forward brings the creature almost uncomfortably close.

Searching through the grocery store for the items they need feels like a treasure hunt, and finding those items and being able to cross them off the list is a sense of satisfaction that she doesn’t get anywhere else.

The plumbing and electricity both shut down within hours of each other, and it’s amazing how quickly household garbage accumulates when the best Ash can do is chuck the bags out a kitchen window. While the first zombie Ash saw has long since wandered off, many more have wandered into her neighborhood to take its place.\n\nAnd, of course, Ash’s food supply dwindles day by day, until it’s bad enough that she knows it’s [[time to leave|leave1]].\n</div><div tiddler="watches" tags="current" created="201804171650" modifier="twee" twine-position="10274,15">Ash hasn’t worn a watch [[since she was small|watchfb]], but with her phone dead and back on her bedside table, she’s spent the last few days just guessing at the time based on the sun.\n\nBut inside the case all the watches are still &lt;i&gt;tick, tick, tick&lt;/i&gt;ing away. She settles on a black one, bulky yet sleek with its color. It displays the date, the temperature, and it even has a compass on the watch face. There’s more meters whose purpose Ash isn’t even sure of in addition to, of course, displaying the time. It’s a ridiculous amount of features for a truly ridiculous prince; more than $350 for a watch.\n\nIt’s not something Ash can even imagine thinking of owning if she had to pay for it, but as it is…she takes it and puts it on her wrist. Underneath it, in the case, is a [[folded piece of paper|warrantyinfo]].\n</div><div tiddler="timejump" tags="current" created="201804171652" modifier="twee" twine-position="10540,12">It hasn’t been quite a full year since Ash found her watch at that store, but as she sits under an awning, looking at the little digital numbers that represent her birthday, she thinks randomly that the manufacturer’s were right to give the watch a yearlong warranty. It’s still keeping the time, and the date, and telling Ash that it’s currently fifty-two degrees out and raining.\n\nThey could have even advertised that it can stand up to just about a year of being spattered in not only dirt and weather, but also zombie blood, if they could have foreseen such a thing.\nShe’d left the store where she’d found it after a few months; a zombie had made it through one of the windows and Ash didn’t want to be caught sleeping by any that crawled through the hole.\n\nStill, a year later and both Ash and the watch are still here, still breathing and ticking.\n\nBeing grateful that you’re still alive isn’t probably what most kids feel on their nineteenth birthday, but here Ash is, still breathing, just as her watch is still &lt;i&gt;tick, tick, tick&lt;/i&gt;ing.\n</div><div tiddler="bodycloseup" tags="current" created="201804171607" modifier="twee" twine-position="5541,547">Close up, it's obvious that without power to the freezers, this body too has started to decay. Even so, it seems less decomposed than the rest of the corpses around her; most of its skin is still on and Ash doesn't see any pus oozing from it, at least not yet.\n\nHer attention lingers on the closed eyes. A lot of the dead that she’s seen so far have had their eyes wide open, either because they're still up and walking or because they'd died that way, eyes wide with terror, and there's been no one to close their eyes for them.\n\nBut this person, with their eyes closed and their head resting on the door to the freezer, looks almost peaceful. As if they had died sequestered away from the chaos that must have surrounded them.\n\n&lt;i&gt;It's not a bad idea&lt;/i&gt;, Ash finds herself musing. [[Freezing to death|winterfb]] is supposed to be peaceful, isn't it?\n</div><div tiddler="insidestore" tags="current" created="201804171602" modifier="twee" twine-position="5143,21">The noise the doors make when they open give Ash a bad feeling, and sure enough, when she gets them open enough to slip into the store she sees another dead body.\n\nIt's been pushed aside by her opening the doors, smearing fresh blood on the ground over the congealed pools that were already there.\n\nShe takes a moment to look at the body, and notices that the side of what used to be this person's skull is caved in.\n\n&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Ash tells them, before [[moving further|is1]] into the grocery store.\n</div><div tiddler="regroup" tags="current" created="201804171633" modifier="twee" twine-position="9202,10">Besides, there’s still the matter of the [[zombie in front of the door to the store|zombie3]].</div><div tiddler="onwards" tags="current" created="201804171556" modifier="twee" twine-position="3449,15">The closer Ash gets to the parking lot of her local grocery store the more she realizes that the bodies here are different. There's something about them that seems...[[fresher|os2]], though she can't explain it satisfactorily even to herself.</div><div tiddler="wakeup" tags="current" created="201804171618" modifier="twee" twine-position="7177,13">Ash wakes up with a shout strangled in her throat and curls into a tight ball under Jaime’s blankets, shutting her eyes and trying to breathe. In and out, in and out. One and two, and three and four. As her heartrate settles Ash can start to hear other noises over the sound of her own breathing. It must be windy outside; she can hear the soft &lt;i&gt;whoosh&lt;/i&gt; and the soft creaking of tree branches. Over the top of it she can hear birds, a strange mix of &lt;i&gt;chirp&lt;/i&gt;ing from the sparrows and &lt;i&gt;coo&lt;/i&gt;ing from the mourning doves.\n\nAsh listens to them until she feels more settled and she sits up, sliding out of Jaime’s bed to look out her window. Down in the street she sees one or two of the creatures ambling around, clearly aimless. The tree branches are indeed moving in the wind, but otherwise there’s a sense of desertion about the world outside.\n\nAsh sighs. She doesn’t want to go back out into it, but she knows she must. She simply didn’t get enough food from the grocery store to camp out for several weeks again. So she tugs her shoes on and heads downstairs, bracing for [[another day|secondday]].\n</div><div tiddler="camp2" tags="current" created="201804171645" modifier="twee" twine-position="9734,271">She goes through the rest of the camping section with a lighter back and a lighter heart. The display tent is open and set up in inside with its own sleeping back, lantern, and portable cook stove. It looks like the perfect place for Ash to spend the night, or even a few nights if she can manage it.\n\nWith that in mind, she starts combing through the portable cooking supplies. She finally finds what she’d wanted in the grocery store; lots and lots of food. There are buckets of emergency rations, boxes full of meal bars, shelves and shelves full of dehydrated emergency food supplies. Ash grabs as much of it as she can fit in her arms and takes them back to the tent, where she stacks them near the portable stove.\n\nShe smiles. She could make this [[a nice permanent place to stay|camp3]].\n</div><div tiddler="camp3" tags="current" created="201804171645" modifier="twee" twine-position="9862,272">Further digging through the supplies reveals water filtration pumps. There’s a few bottles of water left in her own backpack, and more in the defunct fridges by the registers, but she also knows that there’s a river only about a twenty-minute walk away. Local wisdom taught her as a child not to drink from it, or go swimming in it, but Ash figures that the water filtration will probably make it safe. That’s their purpose, after all.\n\nAs the daylight from the windows starts to fade as dusk approaches, Ash takes some of the portable lanterns (batteries included!) and sets them up around the store. One goes in the tent, and she places a second in the middle of the camping section. Then she considers the rest of the store. &lt;&lt;if visited(“clothes”, “shoes”)&gt;&gt; All that’s left is the front section of the store, primarily taken up by the sales counters along with small paraphernalia designed to entice customers waiting in line. However, next to the sales counters are glass [[display cases|cases]], inside which wearable gear and cameras gleam.&lt;&lt;else if visited(“clothes”)&gt;&gt;There’s still [[the wall of shoes|shoes]] in the back section of the store, and a glance down at her own blood and muck covered shoes makes a brand-new pair sound awfully appealing.&lt;&lt;else if visited(“shoes”)&gt;&gt;Now that she has a nice, clean area to stay for a bit, her grimy clothes start to feel less and less comfortable. She eyes the middle of the store, and [[the apparel section|clothes]] strewn around it.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;There’s still [[the wall of shoes|shoes]] in the back section of the store, and a glance down at her own blood and muck covered shoes makes a brand-new pair sound awfully appealing. Likewise, her clothes feel equally grungy and uncomfortable, and [[the apparel section|clothes]] has the promise of fresh clothes.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\n</div><div tiddler="mediafb" tags="fback" created="201804171555" modifier="twee" twine-position="3186,411">&quot;How can you watch this stuff?&quot;\n\nAsh looks away from the TV, where a zombie is busy decapitating a foolish extra. In the doorway to the living room is her mom, looking at the same scene with a frown on her face.\n\n&quot;It's not real,&quot; Ash points out.\n\n&quot;I know that,&quot; her mom sighs, sounding annoyed. &quot;But it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; rather graphic.&quot;\n\nAsh shrugs. Sure the blood looks life-like and the prosthetics are award-winning, but she also knows that the heroes will triumph, like they do every week.\n\n&quot;I just don't think I'll ever understand your monster obsession,&quot; her mom continues.\n\nAsh refrains from rolling her eyes. It's an oft rehashed conversation between the two of them. &quot;It’s not a monster obsession,” Ash argues. “Besides the monsters in this are just monsters, it’s the [[people|killaftermath]] that are interesting.”\n</div><div tiddler="a11" tags="current" created="201804171603" modifier="twee" twine-position="5281,678">Ash isn't sure how much grooming products will help her at this point, but she figures it can't hurt to try to smell and look a little less terrible than the world around her. She snatches up a few sticks of deodorant and a bottle of dry shampoo and is just wandering aimlessly down the rest of the aisle when her eyes land on a mess of [[pads and tampons|tampons]]. It feels like the first stroke of luck Ash has had since this whole thing started.</div><div tiddler="a10" tags="current" created="201804171603" modifier="twee" twine-position="5280,548">Ash wanders through the freezer aisle, thinking vaguely that she might as well sit down and have some ice cream if there's any left. It will be melted, of course; it doesn't look like the freezers are still functioning, but it will still be sugary comfort. Judging by the empty cartons that litter the aisle, plenty of other people have had the same idea.\n\nSeveral of the freezers are cracked open, the glass shattered, and it gives the whole aisle a slightly chilly feel despite the fact that there isn't actually cool air being pumped out of them. \n\nNo, the chill down Ash's spine has much more to do with the fact that some of the jagged edges of the broken doors are stained with blood.\n\nAsh turns to leave the aisle, when she's brought up short by the sight of a [[face|frozenface]] staring out at her from inside one of the freezers.\n</div><div tiddler="jaimes2" tags="current" created="201804171615" modifier="twee" twine-position="6644,15">The inside of Jaime’s house is pretty much the same as its always been, though both darker and colder than normal. Ash brings out her flashlight for the illusion of warmth it provides and [[heads for the stairs|sleepoverfb]] up to Jaime’s room.</div><div tiddler="dusk" tags="current" created="201804171614" modifier="twee" twine-position="6385,16">The sun has begun to set. Ash has a flashlight in her bag, but she’d rather not be stumbling around in the dark with zombies. She’s getting tired anyways, and desperately wants to curl up in bed, shut her eyes, and pretend that this isn’t happening for a few hours. But her own bed is no longer an option, and Ash is resigned to settling for any old bed as long as it’s behind a functional door.\n\nA quick look around lets her recognize Cherry Street; one of the many other streets that make up her neighborhood. Ash actually knows Cherry quite well; her friend Jaime lives on it. Well, live&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;. She doubts that Jaime and her family are still around, no one else is after all. But Jaime’s house is at least familiar, and it’s a goal, so Ash decides to [[make her way|jaimes1]] there.\n</div><div tiddler="bday" tags="current" created="201804171531" modifier="twee" twine-position="270,11">Ash wakes up in her bed, still groggy from sleep. There are mourning doves cooing outside, a calming, familiar sound. It takes several seconds for her to convince herself to lift her head from its nest of pillows, and several seconds more for her to look over at her beside clock. It’s almost eleven, which is odd. She was supposed to go to school today, but apparently she’s slept through not only her alarm but also any attempt by her parents to wake her.\n\nFrowning, Ash checks her phone. The upper left-hand corner says &lt;i&gt;No Service&lt;/i&gt; and it’s been disconnected from the Wi-Fi, which must be why she has no missed messages of any sort commenting on her absence. She gets out of bed intending to go downstairs and whack the router until the Wi-Fi comes back on, but she’s brought up short by what she sees outside her window.\n\n[[There are dead bodies littering the street.|bodies]]\n</div><div tiddler="fight2" tags="current" created="201804171553" modifier="twee" twine-position="3061,13">&lt;i&gt;Crunch!&lt;/i&gt;\n\nThe shockwave that results when Ash's bat hits the creature's skull is completely different from the shockwave of it hitting a ball. Instead of a single, solid &lt;i&gt;whack&lt;/i&gt; it's a messy sound. Not to mention that the creature's head doesn't go flying off the bat the way a softball does, but instead when Ash follows through on the swing she rips away parts of its soft, decayed flesh before the bat hits the bone with a sickening &lt;i&gt;crack&lt;/i&gt;.\n\nIt's so different that Ash nearly drops the bat in shock. Her palms tingling, Ash stumbles back from the creature as it staggers and falls, eyes wide, heart racing, and stomach churning as she takes in the [[gore|gore]] that's resulted.\n</div><div tiddler="parkinglot" tags="current" created="201804171623" modifier="twee" twine-position="8365,17">Ash feels better as she continues on, fresher and cleaner, but having less blood on her doesn’t do anything about the heat or the distance. It also doesn’t do anything about the creatures that dot the landscape which she goes out of her way to avoid, no point in getting dirty again if she doesn’t have to. Ash herself might not smell like rotted flesh and blood, but the very air itself does, and the smell seems to get worse and worse the longer she spends outside. Every corpse she passes makes the stench sharper, harder to ignore, and in some spots where the bodies are clumped together in groups Ash finds herself running past; not only trying to escape the smell but also afraid to look too closely and see whatever tragedy befell these people.\n\nIt’s a hard journey, especially one that used to take her only fifteen minutes by car. But by the time Ash gets to the outdoor equipment store more than a couple of hours have passed and she’s not only exhausted, but can also feel the back of her neck and arms burning and starting to peel under the sun. When she sees the [[three zombies|zambos]] wandering around the parking lot she almost sits down right there and cries.\n</div><div tiddler="a1" tags="current" created="201804171603" modifier="twee" twine-position="5277,151">More death, more decay.\n\nThat's what remains of what [[was|a1fb]] once a nice vegetable aisle. It's been long enough that whatever food was left behind by the people who had gotten here before her has turned foul.\n\nIt adds to the smell of corpses enough to lurch Ash's stomach and she [[leaves|is1]] the aisle as fast as possible.\n</div><div tiddler="watchfb" tags="fback" created="201804171651" modifier="twee" twine-position="10274,151">“It’s…three-forty-five,” Ash says, squinting at the watch. Learning to tell time has been one of the skills she’s been working on at school, and her parents have gotten her a watch to help her practice.\n\nThe [[watch|warrantyinfo]] looks like the old clocks; the non-electronic ones with the numbers along the outside instead of in the middle. It’s harder to read these, but even as Ash frowns about it, she knows that her parents will only tell her that it’s important to learn anyways.\n</div><div tiddler="a4" tags="fback" created="201804171603" modifier="twee" twine-position="5277,285">&quot;Chips aren't on the list,&quot; Ash says uncertainly, frowning at the grocery list. Her dad has pushed the cart down the chips and snacks aisle, even though nothing here is on the list.\n\nHer dad gives her a smile as he throws the bag of chips into their cart. &quot;No, but we can get them anyways,&quot; he assures her.\n\nAsh frowns, thinking about this. &quot;Okays,&quot; she agrees eventually, &quot;but only if we get Oreos too.&quot;\n\nHer dad laughs. &quot;You drive a hard bargain, Ash,&quot; he says. &quot;But alright. One pack, and you have to share them with your mom and I.&quot;\n\nAsh nods in happy agreement as her dad [[pushes her down the aisle|is1]].\n</div><div tiddler="fightzombie2pt3" tags="current" created="201804171630" modifier="twee" twine-position="8944,393">There’s a more solid sounding &lt;i&gt;thump&lt;/i&gt; when Ash hits it in the chest.\n\nThe creature stumbles, bending over now, and Ash sees her chance.\n\nShe takes the bat in both her hands and swings it above her head before bringing it down [[hard|fightzombie2pt4]] on the creature.\n</div><div tiddler="fightzombie2pt2" tags="current" created="201804171630" modifier="twee" twine-position="8944,266">She connects, but not as solidly as she meant to. The creature’s odd movement pattern has worked in its favor, and while Ash has taken off what is roughly half of its face, it’s not enough to knock it down. It makes another wild lunge for Ash, hands outstretched as if to grab her.\n\nAsh darts backwards, her heart in her throat and pure fear pounding through her veins.\n\nShe [[swings|fightzombie2pt3]] again, catching it in the chest this time.\n</div><div tiddler="fightzombie2pt4" tags="current" created="201804171632" modifier="twee" twine-position="8946,522">Finally, it hits the ground fully.

She thinks that if the electricity was still working she probably would have triggered the alarm, but when the crashing sound of glass dies down there’s nothing but silence.\n\nThere’s several different knives inside, but Ash picks a Swiss Army with what looks like at least twenty different attachments. She’s not sure what they all do, or even how to use most of them, so she takes a switch blade as well for good measure, tucking both into her brand new deep pockets.\n\nNext to the knives lies [[a collection of watches|watches]].</div><div tiddler="camp" tags="current" created="201804171642" modifier="twee" twine-position="9604,270">Ash heads to the camping display, where a tent is still miraculously standing, surrounded by shelves of alternates and all the camping gear Ash could ever want. There’s not only tents, but also sleeping bags, thermal blankets, portable cooking supplies, and those fancy hiking backpacks with millions of straps coming off of every bit of them.\n\nDelighted, Ash drops her old backpack and starts trying on the expensive fancy ones. There’s different &lt;i&gt;sizes&lt;/i&gt; of backpacks, optimized for different torso sizes (according to the tags), and they’re clearly better quality than her beat up school backpack. It even has specialized buckles on the bottom to attach a sleeping bag to, which Ash does, oddly excited at this simple functionality.\n\nEventually she settles on one and starts the process of moving everything over to the new, blood stain free backpack. She shrugs it on and buckles it around her hips, shifting the weight off her shoulders, and the [[relief|camp2]] is both instant and immense.\n</div><div tiddler="fightzombie2kill" tags="current" created="201804171632" modifier="twee" twine-position="9069,11">The zombie stops moving completely.\n\nAsh kicks it, just for good measure.\n\nShe refuses to think about how she was almost killed by a zombie because she knows that it will only freak her out and [[make her lose her focus|regroup]].\n</div><div tiddler="whathappened" tags="current" created="201804171558" modifier="twee" twine-position="3840,15">&lt;i&gt;These people killed each other...&lt;/i&gt;\n\nIn panic and desperation, these people had killed one another before the creatures even got a chance to.\n\nThe wave of grief hits her, strong and hard enough that Ash [[stops|os4]] in her tracks.\n</div><div tiddler="bodies" tags="current" created="201804171531" modifier="twee" twine-position="400,12">In an instinctive moment of panic and revulsion Ash yanks her curtains closed and backs away from the window. She shuts her eyes and takes several deeps breaths before she can bring herself to open the curtains and look out again.\n\nThere’s not actually that many bodies, but there &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be zero dead bodies on Ash’s suburban street, and not the ten or so she can see from the window.\n\nEverything is eerily still outside, only bodies lying there. Ash watches the street for several long seconds, and nothing changes. Just as she pulls back to leave the window something out of the corner of her eye catches her attention. At the end of the block [[something|figure]] is moving.\n</div><div tiddler="left" tags="current" created="201804171547" modifier="twee" twine-position="2528,158">Ash takes several quick steps to the left.

Stepping [[forward|forward]] will just take her closer to the creature. More steps to the left aren’t likely to confuse it anymore than it had the first time. Stepping [[back to the right|return]] will put her back where she was, but maybe it will confuse the creature just enough. It doesn’t seem particularly smart. Or, she thinks, she could [[stand her ground|standground]] and fight this thing.\n</div></div></body></html>
