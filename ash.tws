VAsh sticks her hands outside of her makeshift shelter, watching as the rain washes the last few days worth of blood off of them. There\u2019s been a frustrating lack of rain recently, leaving Ash with a backup water supply that is dangerously low and her hands and arms unwashed.\u000a\u000aOn her left wrist her watch gives a quiet <i>beep</i>.\u000a\u000aSurprised, Ash pulls her wrist back under the shelter. It\u2019s blinking 12:00 AM at her, midnight. In the corner of the screen is the date; April 25th. It\u2019s now officially her birthday.\u000a\u000aShe used to stay awake until midnight on her birthday on purpose, counting the seconds until she turned one year older. Nothing ever changed when the clock ticked over, but it always made her feel excited to see her birthday arrive. This year, of course, Ash hasn\u2019t been waiting eagerly for her birthday. In fact, other than seeing the date out of the corner of her eye on her wrist she hasn\u2019t paid much attention to the passage of time, at least not after the first few days.\u000a\u000aIt just hadn\u2019t seemed important.\u000a\u000aBut [[one year since the end of the world|fbstart]] seems like an occasion worth marking.\u000a

VAsh wakes up in her bed, still groggy from sleep. There are mourning doves cooing outside, a calming, familiar sound. It takes several seconds for her to convince herself to lift her head from its nest of pillows, and several seconds more for her to look over at her beside clock. It\u2019s almost eleven, which is odd. She was supposed to go to school today, but apparently she\u2019s slept through not only her alarm but also any attempt by her parents to wake her.\u000a\u000aFrowning, Ash checks her phone. The upper left-hand corner says <i>No Service</i> and it\u2019s been disconnected from the Wi-Fi, which must be why she has no missed messages of any sort commenting on her absence. She gets out of bed intending to go downstairs and whack the router until the Wi-Fi comes back on, but she\u2019s brought up short by what she sees outside her window.\u000a\u000a[[There are dead bodies littering the street.|bodies]]\u000a

VIn an instinctive moment of panic and revulsion Ash yanks her curtains closed and backs away from the window. She shuts her eyes and takes several deeps breaths before she can bring herself to open the curtains and look out again.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s not actually that many bodies, but there <i>should</i> be zero dead bodies on Ash\u2019s suburban street, and not the ten or so she can see from the window.\u000a\u000aEverything is eerily still outside, only bodies lying there. Ash watches the street for several long seconds, and nothing changes. Just as she pulls back to leave the window something out of the corner of her eye catches her attention. At the end of the block [[something|figure]] is moving.\u000a

VAsh looks closer. At the corner of Miller and Chapin she can see someone actually standing up. They\u2019re wavering, clearly injured and listing dramatically to one side. Ash puts her hands on the window, pressing into it in [[an instinctive move to get a better view|zoom]]. It could be her mom, or her dad, or any number of people who live in her neighborhood.\u000a\u000aThe figure takes a jerky step forward.\u000a

VIt\u2019s a completely inhuman movement. The figure doesn\u2019t lean into the motion, almost like the fact that it\u2019s moving comes as a surprise. Its knees are barely bending, and its upper body is rigid and stiff.\u000a\u000aAsh watches, morbidly fascinated, it as it takes several more of these jerky steps, still not rolling its ankles or bending its knees. [[It continues down her street|fall]], slow and creepy, until its feet run into one of the bodies strewn about the street.\u000a

The creature\u2019s skull cracks against the pavement, and although distance and the walls of her house and the glass in the window mute the sound, Ash can still imagine it.\u000a\u000aThe figure makes no move to get up again, but its feet continue to move against the pavement, as if it thinks it\u2019s still walking.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s very weird and confusing and Ash watches it struggle for several long moments. It certainly <i>looks</i> like a human being, but people don\u2019t move like that, and people pick themselves back up when they fall over.\u000a\u000aFrom the left this time Ash seems more movement, [[another figure|zombie2]] with the same lumbering movement.\u000a

At least, its body is pointed that way, although, disturbingly it\u2019s head is tilted backwards. It staggers into a position that gives Ash a look at its [[face|mrlewis]], and this time she yelps and physically jumps back from her window.

VPanicked by the realization, Ash practically runs to the front door and locks the deadbolt. After a moment more of hesitation she grabs the hallway table and drags it over to block the door. It\u2019s probably at best a token gesture but Ash doesn\u2019t want anything into her [[house|house]] any time soon, especially not Mr. Lewis\u2019 surprisingly active corpse.

VThe first thing Ash does when her racing heart calms and her makeshift barricade stays in place is look through her empty house.\u000a\u000aShe finds nothing.\u000a\u000aWhile it had felt normal in the first few moments, the early morning-esque stillness becomes more and more unsettling as the day progresses.\u000a\u000aThe ambient noises of the house are there: the <i>swish</i>es and <i>clunk</i>s of the plumbing, the almost indistinguishable <i>hum</i> of the lights, the occasional <i>creak</i> of something settling. Occasionally, she can still hear the birds <i>coo</i>. It\u2019s a weirdly haunting sound now; an uncomfortable reminder that she can hear them only because things are unusually quiet.\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s no hint of distant traffic, no muffled noise from her neighbor\u2019s television.\u000a\u000a[[Ash is alone|alone]] with the sound of her own breathing, her own footsteps, and the beat of her own heart.\u000a

VOver the next few days, Ash finds herself settling quickly into a routine that is strange only for its appearance of normalcy. While any sort of communication seems to be down; only static from the TV and land line, and disconnected warnings from her cell phone, the electricity and plumbing continues to work.\u000a\u000aThe first afternoon Ash makes herself a sandwich from the fixings in the fridge and takes it over to the window, eating as she watches the creature she saw earlier stumble around the street. Other than the pervasive silence, it\u2019s the only thing that reminds her of what\u2019s happened.\u000a\u000aAfter her sandwich Ash goes through the fridge and the pantry, taking stock of what [[food is in the house|food]]. For three people, there\u2019s probably enough groceries for a little over a week. For Ash alone, if she\u2019s careful? She could survive for a long time without leaving.\u000a

His fur is worn and his head is slightly misshapen, but Ash still loves him. At ten now she might be too old for stuffed animals, but on the other hand, Fritz has seen her safely through those ten years.\u000a\u000aShe rests her chin on the top of his lumpy head and tries to ignore the pain in her knee as her dad swabs it with rubbing alcohol.\u000a\u000aIt had been a silly accident; she\u2019d just tripped on the steps on the back porch, but she\u2019d landed on her knee and left it a bloody mess. Her dad had carried her inside the house and set her on the bathroom counter, carefully dripping water over it while her mom had fetched Fritz for her.\u000a\u000aTears are still drying on Ash\u2019s face but she\u2019s much less scared now with Fritz in her arms and her mom\u2019s hand running soothingly over the top of her head.\u000a\u000a\u201cWe\u2019ve got you, honey,\u201d her mom assures her.\u000a\u000a<<back>>\u000a

VAfter digging around for a while in their old \u201ctrunk of junk\u201d as her dad had called it, Ash is able to find the old Walkman her parents had given her when she was ten, before iPods had become all the rage. Where her first iPod is she doesn\u2019t know, and it probably wouldn\u2019t charge anyways. But the Walkman\u2026in the kitchen there\u2019s a drawer full of batteries, and as soon as Ash puts two AAs into the Walkman she can hear it start spinning when she switches it on.\u000a\u000aThe CDs are trickier to find, but there\u2019s still a stack of them by the computer. Most of the cases are broken and almost everything is in the wrong case, but Ash is still able to find a few albums that she enjoys. She sticks one into the Walkman, making sure it works, and early 2000s pop-rock comes through the headphones, tinny sounding and she remembers how the CDs would always skip as you walked with them, but it\u2019s better than having nothing.\u000a\u000aFor good measure, Ash also takes the rest of the batteries as well.

VThe streets are almost eerily silent as Ash picks her way to the grocery store. Nothing else moves, there's not even wind in the trees. One of her hands clings nervously to the strap of her backpack while the other clutches her bat. She's glad the grip is worn from years of play; it's less slippery as her hands sweat. The more she walks, the less able she is to keep herself convinced that she's just on a grocery run.\u000a\u000aShe hadn't been prepared for the reality; the stench of piles of dead bodies and the heaviness it lends the air. The feeling of [[death|notlife]] that hangs over everything.\u000a

Now faced with one of them coming at her all jerky motions and decaying flesh, she feels weird likening this...<i>thing</i> to the zombies she's experienced safely behind screens and paper.\u000a\u000aIt's slow, but it's clearly seen her, and is interested.\u000aAsh hesitates, deciding.

Instead of a single, solid <i>whack</i> it's a messy sound.

Her palms tingling, Ash stumbles back from the creature as it staggers and falls, eyes wide, heart racing, and stomach churning as she takes in the [[gore|gore]] that's resulted.\u000a

Cuts and bruises that couldn't have formed after death, legs and arms bent at weird angles, wounds and marks that couldn't have come from the creatures. Some are abnormally close together, limbs thrown over each other, as though they died in close contact.\u000a\u000aBut that really stands out is the looks on their faces. The faces that are intact look angry and afraid and not nearly as surprised as the ones Ash had passed earlier. She comes to a halt at a particular couple that catches her eye. It\u2019s two men, and one of them has his fingers locked around the other man\u2019s throat while the second has his fingernails practically embedded into the skin on the back of the first\u2019s hands.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s obvious [[what happened|whathappened]], but even so, Ash has trouble internalizing it.

VAsh isn't sure how much grooming products will help her at this point, but she figures it can't hurt to try to smell and look a little less terrible than the world around her. She snatches up a few sticks of deodorant and a bottle of dry shampoo and is just wandering aimlessly down the rest of the aisle when her eyes land on a mess of [[pads and tampons|tampons]]. It feels like the first stroke of luck Ash has had since this whole thing started.

VAsh wanders through the freezer aisle, thinking vaguely that she might as well sit down and have some ice cream if there's any left. It will be melted, of course; it doesn't look like the freezers are still functioning, but it will still be sugary comfort. Judging by the empty cartons that litter the aisle, plenty of other people have had the same idea.\u000a\u000aSeveral of the freezers are cracked open, the glass shattered, and it gives the whole aisle a slightly chilly feel despite the fact that there isn't actually cool air being pumped out of them. \u000a\u000aNo, the chill down Ash's spine has much more to do with the fact that some of the jagged edges of the broken doors are stained with blood.\u000a\u000aAsh turns to leave the aisle, when she's brought up short by the sight of a [[face|frozenface]] staring out at her from inside one of the freezers.\u000a

VOnce again, Ash starts watching her feet and stepping carefully as she notices bits of broken glass littering the floor of the refridgerated aisle. The floor is especially sticky here; spilled alcohol and soda coating the floor in addition to the tracks of blood that now decorate the grocery store tiles.\u000a\u000aThere's more corpses here than there were elsewhere in the store, and it looks like they'd been fighting. Probably over the beer, Ash supposes, judging by the labels on the bottles that surround most of them.\u000a\u000aSmack in the middle of the aisle lies the corpse of a man in a pool of his own blood. It's not that unusual for Ash anymore, not after the last few hours, but what draws her attention is the [[beer bottle|corpsezoom]] sticking out of his head.\u000a

VAsh hadn\u2019t expected there to be a ton of stuff left in the grocery store, not after so much time has passed, but she still leaves feeling largely dissatisfied. There wasn\u2019t enough food left in the store for her to feel comfortable about holing back up in her house for a few days, like she\u2019d intended.\u000a\u000aBut she can\u2019t stay here, she knows that. It\u2019s far too exposed and there are already more creatures headed towards the parking lot.\u000a\u000aAsh walks the long way around it, giving them a large berth as she [[heads for home|return2]].\u000a

Her dad has pushed the cart down the chips and snacks aisle, even though nothing here is on the list.\u000a\u000aHer dad gives her a smile as he throws the bag of chips into their cart. "No, but we can get them anyways," he assures her.\u000a\u000aAsh frowns, thinking about this. "Okays," she agrees eventually, "but only if we get Oreos too."\u000a\u000aHer dad laughs.

VIt's the way that the beer bottle is lodged in his head that's so morbidly fascinating. Half of the bottle is broken off and lying in shards next to the body. The other half looks like it's been stabbed into the man's face, right at the soft spot around his left eye.\u000a\u000aBlood has dried down the left side of his face and onto the floor, creating a sizable pool.\u000a\u000aIt doesn't look like the type of wound that could have killed him; Ash isn't exactly sure how it works, but it doesn't look like the bottle could have pierced all the way to the man's brain. She wonders what it was that ultimately killed him. Was it slow bleed out from the bottle? Did he fall and hit his head?\u000aIt seems sad in some incomprehensible way that she will never know. Equally sad is that he must have died from fighting over a bottle of beer.\u000a\u000aAsh shakes herself free of the melancholy, and [[leaves the aisle in a rush.|is1]]\u000a

VClose up, it's obvious that without power to the freezers, this body too has started to decay. Even so, it seems less decomposed than the rest of the corpses around her; most of its skin is still on and Ash doesn't see any pus oozing from it, at least not yet.\u000a\u000aHer attention lingers on the closed eyes. A lot of the dead that she\u2019s seen so far have had their eyes wide open, either because they're still up and walking or because they'd died that way, eyes wide with terror, and there's been no one to close their eyes for them.\u000a\u000aBut this person, with their eyes closed and their head resting on the door to the freezer, looks almost peaceful. As if they had died sequestered away from the chaos that must have surrounded them.\u000a\u000a<i>It's not a bad idea</i>, Ash finds herself musing.

She's well prepared with her biggest coat, her hat, her gloves, and her boots.\u000a\u000aHer mother, back in the doorway of their house with her arms wrapped around herself, shivers.

Besides, she's not sure yet if the creatures have a sense of smell, but if they do it makes sense that they could smell blood, especially fresh blood, and she doesn't want to give them any more reason to attack her. Bugs already attack her enough when she's [[on her period|periodfb]], she doesn't need zombies doing it too.\u000a\u000aAsh makes sure to take several boxes of each.

V"It's not gonna work, Mom!" Ash wails, knocking her mother's hand away.\u000a\u000aShe's sitting on the toilet sobbing and shaking as her mom desperately tries to teach her how to use a tampon. It hurts and it's difficult and it\u2019s <i>messy</i>. There's blood not just on the toilet but also smeared on Ash's hands and the inside of her thighs. She wants to wipe the tears from her face, but she can't, not with her hands this dirty.\u000a\u000a"Maybe you should just use pads for a while," Ash's mom suggests.\u000a\u000aBut Ash lost patience with her mom's platitudes an hour ago. Her mom had been excited about her period just a few hours ago, when Ash had come into her room, scared, to tearfully tell her what had happened. "We should go out for dinner," her mom had suggested, "anywhere you'd like."\u000a\u000aAnd then Ash had reminded her of the swim meet that was in just three hours. She can't swim like this.\u000a\u000aAsh cries even harder, ashamed of both the blood and the tears.\u000a\u000a"I'm sure your coach won't mind if you miss one meet," her mom says.\u000a\u000a"That's not the point!" Ash cries. "You don't get it, leave me alone!"\u000a\u000aHer mom hesitates, clearly awkward and unsure as Ash continues to cry. After several moments she does leave, placing tampons and pads on the counter should Ash want to try again.\u000a\u000aWith her mom gone and her dad banished from this part of the house for the time being, Ash is alone, and she finds that it just lets her feel free enough to cry <i>harder</i>, as she lies her head on the counter, sobs, and [[bleeds|a11pt3]].\u000a

VShe runs for several long minutes, down once familiar streets. She quickly loses track of where she is, taking random turns through alleys and backyards whenever she sees a figure on the horizon. Eventually she stops seeing any and the fear fades, along with the adrenaline.\u000a\u000aAsh slumps against the side of the closest house and gasps for breath, grabbing at the painful stitch in her side. As she slowly gets her breath back an odd sort of finality settles around her. Her home is truly gone now; even if she were to work her way back and wait for the creatures to clear the area it wouldn\u2019t be the what it was, what Ash desperately [[wants it to be|birds]].\u000a

VHer first morning in the new house, Ash wakes up to the sound of birds. They sound different than the birds she\u2019s used to; less of a chirp and more of a coo. Kind of like pigeons, but more musical. She lies in bed for several extra minutes, just listening to them. When she does finally go downstairs for breakfast, she resists the temptation to ask her parents about the birds. She curious, but something about listening to them seems private, and she ultimately decides to research them on her own.\u000a\u000aWhen she learns that they\u2019re called mourning doves her first thought is that it\u2019s too sad of a name. The bird\u2019s calls are beautiful, and lying in bed for several extra minutes in the [[early mornings|dusk]] on the weekends quickly becomes part of Ash\u2019s routine.\u000a

VThe sun has begun to set. Ash has a flashlight in her bag, but she\u2019d rather not be stumbling around in the dark with zombies. She\u2019s getting tired anyways, and desperately wants to curl up in bed, shut her eyes, and pretend that this isn\u2019t happening for a few hours. But her own bed is no longer an option, and Ash is resigned to settling for any old bed as long as it\u2019s behind a functional door.\u000a\u000aA quick look around lets her recognize Cherry Street; one of the many other streets that make up her neighborhood. Ash actually knows Cherry quite well; her friend Jaime lives on it. Well, live<i>d</i>. She doubts that Jaime and her family are still around, no one else is after all. But Jaime\u2019s house is at least familiar, and it\u2019s a goal, so Ash decides to [[make her way|jaimes1]] there.\u000a

VIn a stroke of luck, Jaime\u2019s house looks to be largely unaffected. There\u2019s a downed zombie in the front year, and some blood spatter on the side of the house, but a quick walk around it shows no broken windows, and all the doors look shut. In fact, when Ash tries the front door, it\u2019s locked.\u000aAsh knows where Jaime\u2019s parents keep the spare key though, and sure enough, when she turns over the vase on the front porch there\u2019s a key still taped to the bottom of it.\u000a\u000aAsh smiles and takes the key, fitting it easily into the lock and [[heading inside|jaimes2]].\u000a

VThe bedroom is almost exactly the same as it was when [[Ash was here last|bffs]], only a week before the world ended. Jaime\u2019s posters still hang on the walls, and there\u2019s dirty laundry overflowing from the hamper in the corner. Jaime\u2019s laptop is still on her desk, closed and dark, but her phone is gone, likely with Jaime, wherever she is. Ash sighs and sits on her best friend\u2019s bed, unmade of course, because Jaime never makes her bed. Ash wonders idly if that\u2019s something that even matters anymore in this new world. Jaime\u2019s mother would be complaining about Ash sitting on the furniture while dirty, and she wonders if that matters anymore either.\u000a\u000aBut it doesn\u2019t matter to Ash; she\u2019s tired and all of a sudden everything about the terrible day comes crashing down onto her, leaving her utterly exhausted physically, mentally, spiritually. The only concession she makes to propriety is to kick her shoes off before she tucks herself underneath Jaime\u2019s covers and [[falls asleep|dreams]].\u000a

VAsh wakes up with a shout strangled in her throat and curls into a tight ball under Jaime\u2019s blankets, shutting her eyes and trying to breathe. In and out, in and out. One and two, and three and four. As her heartrate settles Ash can start to hear other noises over the sound of her own breathing. It must be windy outside; she can hear the soft <i>whoosh</i> and the soft creaking of tree branches. Over the top of it she can hear birds, a strange mix of <i>chirp</i>ing from the sparrows and <i>coo</i>ing from the mourning doves.\u000a\u000aAsh listens to them until she feels more settled and she sits up, sliding out of Jaime\u2019s bed to look out her window. Down in the street she sees one or two of the creatures ambling around, clearly aimless. The tree branches are indeed moving in the wind, but otherwise there\u2019s a sense of desertion about the world outside.\u000a\u000aAsh sighs. She doesn\u2019t want to go back out into it, but she knows she must. She simply didn\u2019t get enough food from the grocery store to camp out for several weeks again. So she tugs her shoes on and heads downstairs, bracing for [[another day|secondday]].\u000a

VIn the light of day it\u2019s easier to see things that Ash had missed coming in last night. Spread out on the dining room table are a bunch of supplies, clearly considered by Jaime\u2019s family for packing and then deemed not worth the weight. Among the scattered items are parts of mountaineering sets. Which makes sense, given how Jaime\u2019s parents had been such avid outdoors people.\u000a\u000aAsh looks at the gear and thinks. While mountaineering gear might not be specifically useful, it clearly seems that Jaime\u2019s parents were on the right track. An outdoor recreation store isn\u2019t as obvious a place to go as a grocery store and might still have things in it that Ash could make use of. [[It\u2019s quite a bit of a walk|secondday2]] to the nearest store, easily several miles, but it is at the very least some kind of plan.\u000a

Ash has seen more gross things since leaving her house only yesterday than she had in the entirety of her life before, but this is almost so gross she can\u2019t even comprehend how gross it is.\u000a\u000aShe hurries away from the scene, eager to [[leave it behind|secondfightend]] her.\u000a

VIf only getting the blood and chunks of dead flesh clinging to Ash were as easy to get away from. It all dies quickly, turning tacky and uncomfortable quickly in the summer heat. She desperately wants to wash, but plumbing has been down for two weeks and water is too precious a resource for her to waste it.\u000a\u000aSo Ash soldiers on, trying her best not to think about it. It\u2019s hard; the equipment store is several miles away and the longer Ash walks, the more oppressive the heat starts to feel, even though it\u2019s not as hot as it could be. Sweat soon starts to mix with the blood and dirt that\u2019s already covering her and the mixture starts to harden, pulling uncomfortably at her skin.\u000a\u000aAfter about an hour of walking she [[loses patience|cleaning]] with it and as much as she\u2019s loathe to, pulls a water bottle out of her bag and pulls her t-shirt off. She has to turn it inside out to find a clean spot which she pours water on before running it over her arms.\u000a

VIt takes time and focused scrubbing, and by the end of it Ash\u2019s arms are red from all the rubbing, but eventually the water starts to run clear when she pours a little on her arms instead of the mix of red and black of congealed blood and dirt.\u000a\u000aHer face, which she can\u2019t see, is harder to do. Once her hands are clean she wets them again and starts rubbing at the spots on her face that feel tacky and uncomfortable until they feel less so. Her hair she gives up for as a loss, at least until she can get to a proper place to clean.\u000a\u000aShe leaves her dirty t-shirt on the sidewalk where she\u2019d stopped, giving it up for a loss. She takes a clean one out of her bag and pulls it on. She had really hoped to make her clothes last more than one day, she didn\u2019t want to weigh down her pack with too many clothes to start with, and now she\u2019s already ruined one shirt.\u000a\u000aWell, maybe there will be some clothes left in the [[outdoors store|parkinglot]], even if they are all ugly athletic attire.

VAsh feels better as she continues on, fresher and cleaner, but having less blood on her doesn\u2019t do anything about the heat or the distance. It also doesn\u2019t do anything about the creatures that dot the landscape which she goes out of her way to avoid, no point in getting dirty again if she doesn\u2019t have to. Ash herself might not smell like rotted flesh and blood, but the very air itself does, and the smell seems to get worse and worse the longer she spends outside. Every corpse she passes makes the stench sharper, harder to ignore, and in some spots where the bodies are clumped together in groups Ash finds herself running past; not only trying to escape the smell but also afraid to look too closely and see whatever tragedy befell these people.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s a hard journey, especially one that used to take her only fifteen minutes by car. But by the time Ash gets to the outdoor equipment store more than a couple of hours have passed and she\u2019s not only exhausted, but can also feel the back of her neck and arms burning and starting to peel under the sun. When she sees the [[three zombies|zambos]] wandering around the parking lot she almost sits down right there and cries.\u000a

Sure there\u2019s some overturned racks and various merchandise strewn across the floors, but there\u2019s no large pools of blood, which is a huge plus.\u000a\u000aDirectly in front of the entrance, in the middle of the store, is the [[apparel|clothes]] section. There\u2019s lots of clothes strewn on the ground around it, along with clothing racks and hangers, but there seems to be a pretty sizable selection left.\u000a\u000aIn the rear left of the store is [[camping gear|camp]]; tents, sleeping bags, all sorts of things that could prove useful.\u000a\u000aThe rear right is [[walls and walls of shoes|shoes]]. Hiking shoes, running shoes, work shoes, boots. Some of them have been knocked off the wall display, and even from afar Ash can see the shoe boxes flung all over the section, but there still seems to be a lot of shoes left behind, she can probably find some to fit her. \u000a

VAsh heads to the camping display, where a tent is still miraculously standing, surrounded by shelves of alternates and all the camping gear Ash could ever want. There\u2019s not only tents, but also sleeping bags, thermal blankets, portable cooking supplies, and those fancy hiking backpacks with millions of straps coming off of every bit of them.\u000a\u000aDelighted, Ash drops her old backpack and starts trying on the expensive fancy ones. There\u2019s different <i>sizes</i> of backpacks, optimized for different torso sizes (according to the tags), and they\u2019re clearly better quality than her beat up school backpack. It even has specialized buckles on the bottom to attach a sleeping bag to, which Ash does, oddly excited at this simple functionality.\u000a\u000aEventually she settles on one and starts the process of moving everything over to the new, blood stain free backpack. She shrugs it on and buckles it around her hips, shifting the weight off her shoulders, and the [[relief|camp2]] is both instant and immense.\u000a

VPicking through the disorganized chaos of the shoe display proves to be both annoying and time consuming. It\u2019s hard enough for Ash to find shoes in her size among the mass, and even harder to find a pair of matching shoes. It strikes Ash as strange: why would anyone just take one shoe out of a pair? Maybe the missing shoes are somewhere else in the store, but regardless, Ash eventually ends up with [[one pair|shoes2]] of hiking boots in women\u2019s size seven.

VHer mind on the ruined shirt she left behind, Ash heads towards the apparel section of the store. She starts by digging through the piles of clothes on the floor, looking for things that might fit her.\u000a\u000aShe hadn\u2019t expected there to be underwear, but there is, and Ash eagerly grabs several packs, to tear open so she can roll up the underwear inside and shove them into the empty spaces in her bag. Without a good way for her to do laundry, she\u2019s definitely running out of underwear the fastest.\u000a\u000aSimilarly, she also takes quite a few workout tanks; they\u2019re small and can easily rolled up and stuffed alongside what she already has in her pack. And given how fast she seems to be going through clothes, it can\u2019t hurt to have [[alternate layers|clothes2]].\u000a

VShe hesitates longer over the winter gear.

VAsh wanders to the front of the store, making sure to grab the bottles of water from the register displays. She can\u2019t see a use for money in this world, but her attention is drawn by the personal items in the cases nearby. \u000a\u000aIn the first case there\u2019s all sorts of cameras, normal digital ones and ones that are made to be attached to a helmet or a bike. \u000a\u000aThe second case has a display of pocket and Swiss Army knives, and Ash feels silly for not thinking of grabbing one immediately. The cases are locked, but Ash figures it doesn\u2019t really matter at this point if she [[smashes|cases2]] the glass.\u000a

VShe goes through the rest of the camping section with a lighter back and a lighter heart. The display tent is open and set up in inside with its own sleeping back, lantern, and portable cook stove. It looks like the perfect place for Ash to spend the night, or even a few nights if she can manage it.\u000a\u000aWith that in mind, she starts combing through the portable cooking supplies. She finally finds what she\u2019d wanted in the grocery store; lots and lots of food. There are buckets of emergency rations, boxes full of meal bars, shelves and shelves full of dehydrated emergency food supplies. Ash grabs as much of it as she can fit in her arms and takes them back to the tent, where she stacks them near the portable stove.\u000a\u000aShe smiles. She could make this [[a nice permanent place to stay|camp3]].\u000a

VFurther digging through the supplies reveals water filtration pumps. There\u2019s a few bottles of water left in her own backpack, and more in the defunct fridges by the registers, but she also knows that there\u2019s a river only about a twenty-minute walk away. Local wisdom taught her as a child not to drink from it, or go swimming in it, but Ash figures that the water filtration will probably make it safe. That\u2019s their purpose, after all.\u000a\u000aAs the daylight from the windows starts to fade as dusk approaches, Ash takes some of the portable lanterns (batteries included!) and sets them up around the store.

She knows that breaking in these boots might be unpleasant, and if she has to run, she\u2019d rather not do it in stiff, painful shoes.

VIt hasn\u2019t been quite a full year since Ash found her watch at that store, but as she sits under an awning, looking at the little digital numbers that represent her birthday, she thinks randomly that the manufacturer\u2019s were right to give the watch a yearlong warranty. It\u2019s still keeping the time, and the date, and telling Ash that it\u2019s currently fifty-two degrees out and raining.\u000a\u000aThey could have even advertised that it can stand up to just about a year of being spattered in not only dirt and weather, but also zombie blood, if they could have foreseen such a thing.\u000aShe\u2019d left the store where she\u2019d found it after a few months; a zombie had made it through one of the windows and Ash didn\u2019t want to be caught sleeping by any that crawled through the hole.\u000a\u000aStill, a year later and both Ash and the watch are still here, still breathing and ticking.\u000a\u000aBeing grateful that you\u2019re still alive isn\u2019t probably what most kids feel on their nineteenth birthday, but here Ash is, still breathing, just as her watch is still <i>tick, tick, tick</i>ing.\u000a
